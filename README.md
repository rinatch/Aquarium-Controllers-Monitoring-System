# Aquarium-Controllers-Monitoring-System
We've build Aquarium Controllers &amp; Monitoring System using M5Stack sensors + 3D printing 


Sensors: 
  Servo 360
  Ncir to monitor water's temperature
  Color
  Water pump
  
 3D printing:
 By 3D printing We've made a product that has in it all the sensors above. You can put it on your fish aquariuim and it will feed your fished every X hours (you decide) + you'll get a notification if the temperature is high/ low or if the color of the water is green (dirty). Plus, it will pump water when needed.
