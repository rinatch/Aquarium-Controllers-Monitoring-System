We've built Aquarium Controllers &amp; Monitoring System using M5Stack sensors + 3D printing 


Sensors: 
  Servo 360, 
  Ncir to monitor water's temperature, 
  Color, 
  Water pump.
  
 3D printing:
 By 3D printing We've made a product that has in it all the sensors that is written above. 
 
 How to use it?
 You can put our product on your fish aquariuim and it will feed your fishes every X hours (you decide) + you'll get a notification if the temperature is high/ low or if the color of the water is green (dirty). Plus, it will pump water when needed.
